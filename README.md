# T9

T9 is a simple AngularJS application that simulates texting on a standard 10-key keypad by using a backtracking algorithm to generate unique letter combinations. 

## Dependencies

- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)

## Local Development

With [Bower](http://bower.io/) globally, run `bower install` from the command line to install dependencies and begin working on the project locally. 

To view the project in the browser, run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` from the command line and navigate to the specified port, 8000 by default. 

For a server with live reloading (great for rapid development), check out [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server), which requires [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to be installed globally. Once installed, run `live-server` from the command line, and a window/tab will be opened automatically.
